When we are on the next screen this has a menubar display for navigation withing the app. Apart for them a search icon for searching through the product.(Not funtional yet) It also has a Tabbar with 5 tabs for displaying products according to their respective categories. For now i have kept the same things undr each tab.This tab bar has a list view which will be displaying the products belonging to that particular category. This Widget used in this is child of gesture controller which will open the next screen.
This is the last screen within our app which is the product description screen used for showing the particular product in detail.
